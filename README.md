## ✨ Project Overview

Nurad is an Android application engineered to facilitate guest interaction with hotel services. 🛌🛎 

It streamlines room browsing, reservation processes, and booking management. Developed using Android Studio and Java, and leveraging Firebase for backend services, Nurad provides real-time room availability and secure transaction functionalities to end-users. It serves as the primary interface for guests to engage with the hotel's reservation system.
